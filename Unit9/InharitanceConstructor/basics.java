 * The output will be a reference to the object, not a meaningful representation of the person's information.
 * If you want to print meaningful information about the person, you should override the toString method in the Person class:

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person: " + firstName + " " + lastName;
    }

    class Main {

 * You are telling the compiler that you are intentionally providing a new implementation for the toString() method that is already 
 * present in the Object class (since all Java classes implicitly extend Object). The Object class is the root class in the Java 
 * class hierarchy, and it provides certain methods that are inherited by all other classes unless explicitly overridden. So, 
 * it inherits methods like toString(), equals(), hashCode(), and others from Object.
 * 
 * This is why you can override the toString() method in the Person class, which is originally defined in the Object class.
